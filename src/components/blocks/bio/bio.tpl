                        painting technique; in which he mix all kinds of plastic materials in different quantities, which 
                        include, among others, silicon and acrylic, and sprinkle them on the canvas.

                        to the end result. This technique is 100% hand made by Natan, and there is no machinery involved in it.

                    Most of my time after school was shared with my Mom in our kitchen. She was an excellent cook and I 
                    used to sit with her there, talk with her, do my homework, draw in my sketchbook, help her with all

                        me in particular is the positive side of human beings. I’m not interested in dealing with hate, envy,

                        love, yearning, nostalgia, longing, appreciation, honor and gratitude.”
