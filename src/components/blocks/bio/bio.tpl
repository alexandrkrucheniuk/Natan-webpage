                        Ever since painting became an integral part of his life, Natan has worked to develop his unique 
                        painting technique, in which he mixes all kinds of plastic materials in different quantities, which 
                        include, amongst other things silicon and acrylic, which he then applies on the canvas.

                        This medium creates a 3D texture
                        on the surface. Sometimes he adds Swarovski elements and all kinds of glitter to
                        the end result. The materials are painstakingly and entirely made by Natan, and there is
                        no machinery involved in the process.

                        play Wonder Woman. When their work together was done, he presented the actress with
                        her portrait.

                        made materials. As he recalls, this stems from his deep seated roots in the
                        kitchen, embedded in him from early childhood.

                    “Most of my time after school was shared with my Mom in our kitchen. She was
                    an excellent cook and I used to sit with her there and talk to her, do my homework, draw
                    in my sketchbook and help her with all the cooking. I would decorate the food before it
                    was served, creating small works-of- art from food by
                    using a variety of Kitchenware.”

                        cynicism, my great appreciation and endless thanks to them for building my inner world.
                        My paintings come from my great appreciation and personal gratitude to the painted
