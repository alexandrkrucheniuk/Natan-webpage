            Most of my time after school was shared with my Mom in our kitchen. She was an excellent cook and I 
            used to sit with her there, talk with her, do my homework, draw in my sketchbook, help her with all 
            the cooking, decorate the food before service, making little art works from food by using variety of kitchenware

                me in particular is the positive side of human beings. I’m not interested in dealing with hate, envy,

                I was always driven by love; love to the family, to friends, to making, to nature and its surroundings. 
                And maybe because of that, when I paint, I choose to emphasize those positive aspects of humanity, like 
                love, yearning, nostalgia, longing, appreciation, honor and gratitude.”
